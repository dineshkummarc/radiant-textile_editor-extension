= Textile Editor

Created by Jason Garber, September, 2008.  Based on the Textile Editor Helper plugin from WVU.

Textile Editor places a bar above the textarea when Textile is the current input filter.

==Forked!

This fork extends TE to work with Paperclipped as well as Page Attachments. At the moment it depends on a couple of changes I've made to Paperclipped - some named scope and a method that returns the list of thumbnail sizes - but if those don't get incorporated it's easy enough to work around.

Still to do: 

* links to assets
* inline uploads from the image popup. This is always horrible, requires flash and probably won't work, but if it does then we can replace the assets bucket entirely for non-admin users.
