= Textile Editor

Created by Jason Garber, September, 2008.  Based on the Textile Editor Helper plugin from WVU.

Textile Editor places a bar above the textarea when Textile is the current input filter.

==Forked!

This fork extends TE to work with Paperclipped assets as well as Page Attachments. At the moment it depends on a couple of changes I've made to Paperclipped - some named scope and a method that returns the list of thumbnail sizes - but if those don't get incorporated it's easy enough to work around.

I've cleaned up one or two minor inconsistencies that were affecting the popup formatting but otherwise I've worked carefully within the existing code (which was already nicely extensible).

Maybe to do: 

* inline uploads from the image popup. This is always horrible, requires flash and probably won't work, but if it does then we can replace the assets bucket entirely for non-admin users.
